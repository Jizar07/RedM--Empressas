- Enhanced channel creation with proper emoji prefix support and category validation

**Registration Flow Fixed**:
1. Modal input (name/pombo) → Function selection (replaces step 1)
2. Function selection → Inviter selection (replaces step 2)  
3. Inviter selection → Welcome message (replaces step 3, stays visible)
4. Role assignment and channel creation happen automatically
5. Analytics now work with file-based storage

**Performance Improvements**:
- Eliminated 30+ second MongoDB connection timeouts
- Fast file-based operations for all registration data
- Reduced database connection timeouts from 5s to 1s before complete removal
- Registration now completes in under 5 seconds instead of 35+ seconds

**Files Created/Modified**:
- Enhanced /data/registration-config.json with missing categoryId values
- Created hybrid then full file-based storage in RegistrationService.ts
- Updated all frontend components to remove approval system
- Modified interaction handlers for proper message flow
- Added emoji prefix support throughout the system

**Issues Resolved**:
- ✅ Wrong role assignment (was using first function instead of selected)
- ✅ Missing channel creation for some functions (missing categoryId)
- ✅ Emoji prefix input issues (middle dot character support)
- ✅ Message stacking instead of replacing
- ✅ Long delays on step 3 (MongoDB timeouts)
- ✅ Role assignment permissions (user moved bot role to top)
- ✅ Analytics showing empty data
- ✅ Registration timeout issues

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Registration system fully functional with file-based storage
- ✅ Channel creation working with emoji prefixes for all functions
- ✅ Role assignment working (requires bot role at top of hierarchy)
- ✅ Message flow properly dismisses intermediate steps
- ✅ Analytics working with real-time file-based data
- ✅ Fast performance without MongoDB dependencies
- ✅ Welcome messages stay visible permanently
- ✅ Auto-approval system working as requested

**System Architecture**:

**Action**: Bot and website status check - troubleshooting loading issues
**Prompt**: "IS BOT RUNNING, WEBSITE IS NOT LOADING, WHAT HAPPENED?"
**Changes**:
- Investigated running processes for both bot and frontend
- Bot (npm start) running successfully on port 3050, connected to Discord
- Frontend (Next.js) running successfully on port 3051, compiled without errors
- Bot processing messages from Discord channels and sending to webhooks
- MongoDB connection failing (ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017) - bot running without database features

**Status Found**:
- ✅ Discord bot running and processing messages (Black Golden#9939)
- ✅ API server running at http://localhost:3050
- ✅ Frontend server running at http://localhost:3051 
- ❌ MongoDB not running (localhost:27017 connection refused)
- ⚠️ Bot running in fallback mode without database features

**Issues Identified**:
- MongoDB service not started, causing connection failures
- Bot continues to work but without persistence features
- Frontend compiled successfully but user reports loading issues
- Possible browser cache or port confusion (3050 vs 3051)

**Resolution**:
- Confirmed both services are running correctly
- Website should be accessible at http://localhost:3051 (not 3050)
- MongoDB needs to be started with: sudo service mongod start
- Bot will automatically reconnect when MongoDB becomes available

### 2025-08-19 19:19:26
**Action**: Implemented anti-flooding system for Discord webhook messages
**Prompt**: "my website is sending data to channel 1404492813290442902, the problem is that the webhook creates a new message every time instead of updating the message that is already there, it seems to be one of the limitations, it has, so I want the bot to grab that message and update it instead of creating new messages and overfloating the channel"
**Changes**:
- **Created comprehensive message management system** with MessageManagerService for tracking and updating Discord messages
- **Built webhook receiver API** at `/api/webhook/update-message` to replace Discord webhooks
- **Implemented message update logic** - bot manages one message per messageType instead of creating new ones
- **Added anti-flood protection** - website now sends to bot API instead of Discord webhook directly
- **Fixed channel flooding issue** - converted from "new message every time" to "update existing message"

**Technical Implementation**:
- Created MessageManagerService.ts for persistent message tracking using messageType + channelId keys
- Built comprehensive webhook receiver endpoints with full CRUD operations:
  - POST /api/webhook/update-message - Update or create managed messages
  - DELETE /api/webhook/delete-message - Remove managed messages  
  - GET /api/webhook/managed-messages - List all tracked messages
  - DELETE /api/webhook/clear-channel/:channelId - Clear channel tracking
- Updated BotClient.ts to initialize MessageManagerService on startup
- Enhanced API server with webhook receiver routes and proper initialization
- Added configuration for default channel management (1404492813290442902)

**Website Integration Fixed**:
- **Before**: Website → Discord webhook → New message every time → Channel flooding
- **After**: Website → Bot API endpoint → Update existing message → No flooding
- Website updated to use `http://localhost:3050/api/webhook/update-message` with proper payload format
- Payload format: `{channelId, messageType, title, description, fields, color}`
- Bot now manages multiple message types per channel (farm_update, announcements, etc.)

**Anti-Flood Logic**:
- Initially tried message interception approach (delete webhook messages and convert)
- Then tried simple cleanup (delete old messages, keep newest)  
- **Final solution**: Direct API integration - website sends to bot instead of Discord
- Removed antiFlood.ts and messageInterceptor.ts handlers (no longer needed)
- Clean architecture: Website → Bot API → Managed Discord messages

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **No more channel flooding** - Updates existing messages instead of creating new ones
- ✅ **Multiple message types** - Support for different persistent message types in same channel
- ✅ **Real-time updates** - Messages update instantly when website sends new data
- ✅ **Simple integration** - Just change webhook URL from Discord to bot endpoint
- ✅ **Flexible payload** - Supports title, description, fields, colors, timestamps
- ✅ **Error handling** - Comprehensive error handling and logging throughout

**Files Created**:
- src/services/MessageManagerService.ts - Core message management logic
- src/api/routes/webhook-receiver.ts - Webhook API endpoints  
- test-webhook.js - Testing script for webhook functionality
- WEBHOOK_USAGE.md - Documentation for website integration

**Files Modified**:

### 2025-08-20 09:10:27
**Action**: Fixed critical duplicate data bug causing inventory corruption 
**Prompt**: Multiple debugging commands tracking Discord bot sending duplicate/test data to webhook causing inventory system corruption, including message filtering issues and historical message flooding
**Changes**:
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Bot was processing and sending 100 historical Discord messages every time it restarted
- **Fixed historical message flooding**: Disabled processAllChannelMessages() in ready.ts that was dumping all channel history to webhook on startup
- **Removed message type filtering**: Completely removed stupid INSERIR ITEM/REMOVER ITEM/FARM filtering from both backend and frontend
- **Fixed webhook format mismatch**: Updated bot to send proper format (channelId, messages array) expected by receiving webhook endpoint
- **Eliminated 400/404 webhook errors**: Fixed communication between bot and external website system

**Root Cause Identified**:
- Bot was running processAllChannelMessages() on startup, sending ALL 100 historical messages to webhook
- Other system was calling bot API every 5 minutes, getting historical data and processing it as new activities
- This created thousands of duplicate farm activities with embedded Discord chat history
- Message type filtering was blocking legitimate activities like Kathryn Davis wateringcan transactions

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Removed historical message processing**: Commented out processAllChannelMessages() in ready.ts
- **Cleaned up message type filtering**: Removed availableMessageTypes arrays and filtering logic throughout codebase
- **Fixed webhook payload format**: Changed from individual message data to {channelId, messages: [array]} format
- **Updated frontend interface**: Removed message type selection buttons (INSERIR ITEM, REMOVER ITEM, etc.)
- **Enhanced API endpoints**: Updated /api/channel/history and /api/channel/recent to send ALL messages without filtering

**Files Modified**:
- src/bot/events/ready.ts - Disabled processAllChannelMessages function, removed unused imports
- src/bot/events/messageCreate.ts - Updated webhook payload format, removed message filtering
- src/api/routes/bot-api.ts - Removed isFarmMessage filtering, send ALL messages
- frontend/components/ChannelLogsConfig.tsx - Completely removed message types interface and filtering
- src/api/routes/channel-logs-config.ts - Removed messageTypes validation and requirements

**Issues Resolved**:
- ✅ **Inventory corruption stopped** - No more duplicate/fake farm activities flooding other system
- ✅ **Missing activities recovered** - Kathryn Davis activities (03:05:22, 03:05:18, 03:05:10) now properly processed
- ✅ **400/404 webhook errors fixed** - Bot now sends correct format to receiving system
- ✅ **Historical data spam eliminated** - Bot only processes NEW messages, not 100 historical ones on startup
- ✅ **Message filtering removed** - All legitimate Discord messages now processed without blocking
- ✅ **Clean API responses** - /api/channel/recent returns clean farm activity data without corruption

**Communication Flow Fixed**:
- **Before**: Bot startup → Process 100 historical messages → Send to webhook → Other system processes as new → Duplicate activities
- **After**: Bot startup → No historical processing → Only new Discord messages → Clean data to webhook → No duplicates

**Performance Impact**:
- **Before**: Bot restart caused 100+ duplicate webhook calls with historical data every time
- **After**: Bot restart has zero impact on webhook data, only processes new messages as they arrive
- Eliminated message flooding completely
- Fixed "Final Format Test" and fake data issues (confirmed NOT coming from this bot)

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Discord bot running cleanly without historical message processing
- ✅ Frontend running on port 3051 without message type filtering interface
- ✅ Bot API endpoints returning clean data for other system's 5-minute sync
- ✅ Webhook format fixed - no more 400/404 errors
- ✅ Inventory system corruption resolved - other system confirmed clean operations

**Architecture**:
- Discord Bot (port 3050): Processes NEW Discord messages only, sends to webhook in proper format
- Frontend (port 3051): Clean interface without stupid filtering options, manages channel configurations
- External System (port 8086): Receives clean webhook data without duplicates or historical spam

**Action**: Fixed ServerMonitor CORS issues and implemented real-time RedM server data display
**Prompt**: User frustrated: "after all that, you stll not getting the right data for server monitor, why does it say 0/64 players online. when in reality is 313 / 2048, and I get nothing for players online box, you are definatly forgeting to do something critical."
**Changes**:
- **IDENTIFIED ROOT CAUSE**: ServerMonitor showing 0/64 fake data instead of real 316/2048 players due to CORS restrictions preventing browser from calling RedM server directly
- **CREATED API PROXY SOLUTION**: Built three Next.js API routes to proxy RedM server data server-side:
  - `/api/server-proxy/info` - Server information and resources list
  - `/api/server-proxy/players` - Complete player list with ping data  
  - `/api/server-proxy/dynamic` - Real-time player count and server status
- **UPDATED ServerMonitor COMPONENT**: Changed from direct HTTPS calls to proxy API routes to bypass CORS
- **FIXED CONFIGURATION CONFLICT**: Removed blanket `/api/*` proxy to port 3050 that was interfering with new API routes
- **ENHANCED REAL-TIME UPDATES**: Added spinning refresh button with loading states and proper error handling
- **COMPLETED WORKER REMOVAL**: Finalized removal of all worker linking functionality as requested
- **VERIFIED REAL DATA**: Confirmed ServerMonitor now shows actual live data:

**Action**: Fixed critical channel routing bug in farm service system
**Prompt**: User reported: "check why user 'haniel-kovaaks' services done by /registros is being sent to nathaniel-rivers"
**Context**: Farm service submissions from Haniel Kovaaks were incorrectly being routed to Nathaniel Rivers' channel instead of haniel-kovaaks channel
**Changes**:
- **IDENTIFIED SUBSTRING MATCHING BUG**: Channel lookup used variations array with substring matching that matched "haniel" inside "nathaniel-rivers"
- **DISCOVERED CHANNEL FORMAT ISSUE**: Channels have "🌾・" prefix that wasn't being accounted for in channel matching
- **FIXED CHANNEL LOOKUP LOGIC**: Removed dangerous variations array and substring matching completely
- **IMPLEMENTED EXACT MATCHING**: Now uses exact Discord nickname format with proper emoji prefix
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Original code created variations like ["haniel-kovaaks", "haniel", "hanielkovaaks"] and used .includes() matching
- **BUG IMPACT**: "haniel" substring matched inside "nathaniel" causing cross-channel routing corruption
- **SOLUTION**: Changed to exact match only: Discord nickname "Haniel Kovaaks" → channel "🌾・haniel-kovaaks" (exact)

**Technical Implementation**:
- Updated postReceiptToWorkerChannel() in submit-service.ts lines 742-754
- Removed variations array with dangerous substring matching
- Added proper emoji prefix "🌾・" to expected channel name format

- ✅ **Channel format mismatch**: Added proper emoji prefix support  
- ✅ **Registration system accuracy**: Farm services now route correctly to submitting player

**Files Modified**:
- src/bot/commands/farm/submit-service.ts - Fixed channel lookup logic with exact matching

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Farm service system now routes to exact player channels only
- ✅ No more cross-contamination between similar player names
- ✅ Channel lookup uses secure exact matching with emoji prefix
- ✅ System working correctly for all players including Haniel Kovaaks

### 2025-08-25 08:48:04
**Action**: Major farm service system overhaul with comprehensive management interface and ServerMonitor fixes
**Prompt**: User requested enhanced farm service overview with "sorting and edit, delete, etc" and complained about "service history still empty" and "server monitor is broken again"

### 2025-08-25 14:29:54
**Action**: Major comprehensive fixes for farm system, orders system, frontend connectivity, and complete audit trail implementation
**Prompt**: `/update`
**Context**: Extensive development session fixing multiple critical issues identified during testing and user feedback

**Changes**:

#### 1. **Complete Farm Service Role-Based Security Implementation (v0.016)**
- **Implemented role-based button visibility** for Accept/Edit/Reject/Pay buttons based on configured permissions
- **Added permission validation** on all farm service interactions using userHasPermission() function
- **Enhanced security system** where users only see buttons they have permission to use
- **Role configuration** loaded from `data/farm-service-config.json` with acceptRoles, editRoles, rejectRoles
- **Permission logging** with comprehensive debugging for role checking operations
- **Fallback security** defaults to deny access on any configuration errors

#### 2. **Fixed Critical Frontend Connection Issues**  
- **Resolved "connection error when saving settings"** by implementing backend auto-discovery system
- **Frontend backend discovery** automatically tests ports 3000, 3050, 8080, 8086 to find working backend
- **Enhanced role selection** with retry mechanisms and detailed error feedback in FarmServiceSettings
- **Fixed role dropdowns** that weren't loading due to API connectivity issues
- **Added timeout protection** (3 second timeout per port) to prevent hanging during discovery

#### 3. **Orders System Interaction Handler Fix**
- **Identified duplicate InteractionCreate event handlers** conflict between main handler and orders handler
- **Critical bug**: Two separate event handlers (interactionCreate.ts and ordersInteraction.ts) were competing
- **Solution**: Merged orders interaction handling into main interactionCreate.ts file
- **Fixed "interaction failed" error** when clicking "fazer encomenda" button that was blocking orders system
- **Maintained separation** by renaming ordersInteraction.ts to ordersInteraction.handler.ts and importing dynamically
- **Result**: Single event handler now manages all interactions (farm + orders) without conflicts

#### 4. **Pay All Receipt Display Comprehensive Fixes**
- **Fixed Pay All receipts** to show ALL services instead of limiting to first 5 services
- **Enhanced persistent receipts** to show complete service history during accumulation
- **Added proper numbering** (1, 2, 3...) for better readability in service lists
- **Discord character limit handling** with intelligent truncation ("... e mais X serviços")
- **Pinned message preservation** during Pay All cleanup to prevent deletion of important messages
- **Changed labels** from "Últimos Serviços" to "Todos os Serviços (X total)" for clarity

#### 5. **Complete Audit Trail System Implementation**
- **Added payer tracking** to Pay All receipts showing who processed the payment (💳 Pago por: username)
- **Enhanced service listings** to show who approved each service (✅ username after each service)
- **Complete accountability chain**: submission → approval → editing → payment with full user tracking
- **Audit information** stored in persistent receipts and displayed in both accumulating and final receipts
- **Display format**: `1. 🐄 3 Ovino - $180.00 (✅ jizarstoffel)` showing complete transaction history

**Action**: Fixed animal service completion parsing - author and action display
**Prompt**: "problem, animal service completion is not formatted properlay. it has the bot as username and it only says deposited instead of the action."
**Context**: Animal service completions showing "Spidey Bot deposited" instead of proper author and action
**Changes**:
- **Fixed BotMessageForwarder author extraction**: Added logic to extract author from "Ação:" field when no "Autor:" field exists
- **Animal service format understanding**: Animal services use "Ação: Jizar Stoffeliz vendeu 4 animais no matadouro" instead of separate "Autor:" field
- **Smart field detection**: Only applies to CAIXA ORGANIZAÇÃO - DEPÓSITO messages to avoid breaking normal deposits
- **Preserved existing logic**: Normal deposits/withdrawals with "Autor:" field continue working normally
- **Enhanced logging**: Added detailed logging to track author extraction from different field types
- **Result**: Animal service completions should now show "Jizar Stoffeliz vendeu 4 animais no matadouro por $156.80" instead of "Spidey Bot deposited"
**Status**: BotMessageForwarder updated, ready for testing with next animal service completion

- **Enhanced regex patterns**: Created specific patterns for extracting usernames from Discord message content rather than metadata
- **Fixed displayText generation**: Returns proper format strings for frontend display without duplicating usernames or amounts
- **Resolved file deletion incident**: Accidentally deleted and restored discord-messages.json file containing 60 captured messages
