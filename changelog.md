### [0.008] - 2025-08-20
- **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Resolved major inventory corruption issue caused by Discord bot historical message flooding
- **Fixed Historical Message Spam**: Disabled processAllChannelMessages() function that was sending 100+ duplicate messages to webhook on every bot restart
- **Removed Message Type Filtering**: Eliminated unnecessary INSERIR ITEM/REMOVER ITEM/FARM filtering that was blocking legitimate activities
- **Fixed Webhook Communication**: Updated webhook payload format to match receiving system requirements (channelId, messages array)
- **Eliminated 400/404 Errors**: Resolved communication issues between Discord bot and external website system
- Root cause identified:
  - Bot was processing ALL 100 historical Discord messages every time it restarted
  - Other system was calling bot API every 5 minutes and processing historical data as new activities
  - This created thousands of duplicate farm activities with embedded Discord chat history
  - Message type filtering was preventing legitimate activities like Kathryn Davis wateringcan transactions (03:05:22, 03:05:18, 03:05:10) from being processed
- Technical fixes implemented:
  - Disabled historical message processing in src/bot/events/ready.ts

  - Fixed webhook payload format mismatch between bot and receiving system
  - Updated frontend to remove message type selection interface
  - Enhanced API endpoints to send ALL messages without arbitrary filtering
- Performance improvements:
  - Before: Bot restart caused 100+ duplicate webhook calls with historical spam
  - After: Bot restart has zero impact on webhook data, only processes NEW messages
  - Eliminated inventory system corruption completely
  - Fixed missing activity data issues
- Files modified:
  - src/bot/events/ready.ts - Removed processAllChannelMessages, cleaned unused code
  - src/bot/events/messageCreate.ts - Fixed webhook format, removed filtering
  - src/api/routes/bot-api.ts - Removed isFarmMessage filtering

  - External System (8086): Receives clean webhook data without duplicates
