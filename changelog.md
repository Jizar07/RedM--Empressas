### [0.012] - 2025-08-24
- **Fixed ServerMonitor Real-Time Data Display - CORS Issue Resolved**: Completely resolved critical issue preventing ServerMonitor from displaying real RedM server data
- **CORS Proxy Solution**: Created three Next.js API routes to bypass browser CORS restrictions:
  - `/api/server-proxy/info` - Server information and resource list (working)
  - `/api/server-proxy/players` - Complete player list with ping data (316+ players)
  - `/api/server-proxy/dynamic` - Real-time player count and server status (316/2048 online)
- **Real Data Display Verified**: ServerMonitor now shows actual live RedM server data instead of fake 0/64 fallback:
  - Server name: "ATLANTA SEASON 2 - 3 ANOS ONLINE"
  - Player count: 316+ out of 2048 maximum slots
  - Complete player list with names and ping values
  - Real-time updates every 30 seconds without page refresh
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Added spinning refresh button with loading states and comprehensive error handling
- **Configuration Fix**: Removed conflicting Next.js proxy configuration that was interfering with new API routes
- **Worker Functionality Removal**: Completed removal of all worker linking functionality as requested by user
- **Independent Operation**: ServerMonitor now fully standalone without backend dependencies
- Technical implementation:
  - Created three API proxy routes using Next.js 14 App Router with server-side fetching

  - Enhanced fetchServerData() with isRefreshing state and visual feedback
  - Removed all worker-related interfaces, state variables, and UI components
  - Added comprehensive error handling for server offline states
- Root cause analysis:
  - Browser CORS policies prevented direct calls from localhost:3051 to RedM server
  - Next.js proxy configuration was intercepting API routes before they could execute
  - Component was falling back to mock data when real API calls failed silently
  - User frustration: "why does it say 0/64 players online when reality is 313/2048"
- Files created:
  - /app/api/server-proxy/info/route.ts - Server info proxy with HTTP endpoint
  - /app/api/server-proxy/players/route.ts - Players data proxy with HTTP endpoint
  - /app/api/server-proxy/dynamic/route.ts - Dynamic server data proxy with HTTP endpoint
- Files modified:
  - /components/ServerMonitor.tsx - Updated API calls, removed worker functionality, enhanced UX
  - /next.config.js - Removed conflicting proxy configuration blocking API routes
- Testing verified:
  - API routes return real server data: 316+ players online, server name, complete player list
  - ServerMonitor displays actual live data from RedM server at 131.196.197.140:30120
  - Real-time updates work without page refresh using 30-second polling
  - Enhanced refresh button shows loading states and prevents duplicate requests
- Status: üü¢ ServerMonitor fully functional with real-time RedM server data display
- **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**: User can now see actual 316+ players online instead of fake 0/64 data
